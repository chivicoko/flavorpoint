# FlavorPoint - Restaurant management and Recipes

This project can be viewed at [FlavorPoint](https://chivicoko.github.io/flavorpoint/).

## How it works

Basically, this app, named 'FlavorPoint', gives the user the opportunity to be able to access a restaurant's menu and recipes. In the future, the user will be able to book a seat at the restaurant of his choice in his specified locality/city. The user will be able to communicate with the managers of the restaurant. They will receive services via this app. The managers/admin will be able to attend to customers, showcase their products, render all the available restaurant services. They can basically manage the restaurant smoothly, through the app.
